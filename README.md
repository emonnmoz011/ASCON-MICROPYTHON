# MicroPython Ascon Implementation
This repository contains a lightweight, efficient implementation of the Ascon cryptographic algorithm, specifically tailored for MicroPython environments. Ascon is the winner of the CAESAR competition for authenticated encryption and hashing, designed for high security and efficiency.

Our MicroPython version of Ascon brings these strengths to resource-constrained devices such as microcontrollers that support MicroPython, providing robust, optimized security solutions.

**Features**
Hashing: Utilize Ascon's hashing capability to ensure data integrity across your devices.
Encryption and Decryption: Leverage Ascon's authenticated encryption to protect your data from unauthorized access and tampering.
This project includes a demo example to showcase how these features can be utilized in a MicroPython environment.

**How to Use**
Clone the repository or download the files.
If your microcontroller supports MicroPython, you should be able to import the library using the command import ascon_micropython.
Follow the demo example to understand how to leverage hashing, encryption, and decryption in your application.
